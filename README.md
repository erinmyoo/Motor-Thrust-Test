# Motor-Thrust-Test
REU 2024
The goal of the Motor Thrust Test is to evaluate the reliability of the motors chosen for a solar-powered UAV called the Gannet. Specifically, the test will reveal the performance of the motors running continuously for 24-72 hours while being exposed to a saltwater environment.

## Test Stand Design
Completed Solidworks CAD Assembly and BOM is uploaded
Everything was machined used horizontal bandsaw and mill, except for the 3D printed Motor Mount

Important Features:
* Motor Mount: 3D printed, cross mounting pattern to fit motors from 19 mm to 25 mm
* Single-Point Load Cell: withstand up to 10 kg of pressure
* Z-bar Configuration: accounts for the lip of the test tank, COG allows for the motor to fall back into the tank when disengaged
* Base Angle Brackets: bearings to allow the Z-bar to rotate, slots on top for hardstops
* Hardstops: two slots to press fit into Base Angle Brackets to contrain movement
